## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Choose one of the following deployment methods:

### Without Docker

- Node.js : version 20 or higher
- PNPM : Learn more about [here](https://pnpm.io/)

### With Docker

- Docker and Docker Compose

## üìñ Getting Started

Choose your deployment method:

### üê≥ Using Docker (Recommended)

Using Docker Compose (recommended):
You can find the docker compose configuration in the repository:
[docker-compose.yml](/compose.yml)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Or using Docker directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -e WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  ralex91/rahoot:latest
```

**Configuration Volume:**
The `-v ./config:/app/config` option mounts a local `config` folder to persist your game settings and quizzes. This allows you to:

- Edit your configuration files directly on your host machine
- Keep your settings when updating the container
- Easily backup your quizzes and game configuration

The folder will be created automatically on first run with an example quiz to get you started.

The application will be available at:

- Web Interface: http://localhost:3000
- WebSocket Server: ws://localhost:3001

### üõ†Ô∏è Without Docker

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot.git
cd ./Rahoot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Change the environment variables in the `.env` file

4. Build and start the application:

```bash
# Development mode
pnpm run dev

# Production mode
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration is split into two main parts:

### 1. Game Configuration (`config/game.json`)

Main game settings:

```json
{
  "managerPassword": "PASSWORD",
  "music": true
}
```

Options:

- `managerPassword`: The master password for accessing the manager interface
- `music`: Enable/disable game music

### 2. Quiz Configuration (`config/quizz/*.json`)

Create your quiz files in the `config/quizz/` directory. You can have multiple quiz files and select which one to use when starting a game.

Example quiz configuration (`config/quizz/example.json`):

```json
{
  "subject": "Example Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the correct answer?",
      "answers": ["No", "Yes", "No", "No"],
      "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/....",
      "solution": 1,
      "cooldown": 5,
      "time": 15
    }
  ]
}
```

Quiz Options:

- `subject`: Title/topic of the quiz
- `questions`: Array of question objects containing:
  - `question`: The question text
  - `answers`: Array of possible answers (2-4 options)
  - `image`: Optional URL for question image
  - `solution`: Index of correct answer (0-based)
  - `cooldown`: Time in seconds before showing the question
  - `time`: Time in seconds allowed to answer

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Access the manager interface at http://localhost:3000/manager
2. Enter the manager password (defined in quiz config)
3. Share the game URL (http://localhost:3000) and room code with participants
4. Wait for players to join
